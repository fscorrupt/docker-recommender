## What Does It Do?

- Shows you movies and TV shows you might like based on your ratings
- Learns your preferences over time
- Adds recommendations to your Plex watchlist
- Creates and manages Plex collections
- Works with your existing Plex libraries

The app runs completely independently of your Plex server. It only interacts with Plex to:
- Read your library contents during initial scan
- Add items to your watchlist when requested
- Create/modify collections when requested
- Fetch poster images for display
- Sync watch history (if enabled) to give improved recommendations
- Sync Plex server side ratings (if enabled) to give improved recommendations

All recommendation logic, learning, and data storage happens locally in the app. Your Plex server is never modified without explicit actions from you.
